/data/sce_mct1_omics	This manuscript; DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.039	mct1_ in S. cereviseae	"RNA-seq: WT vs mct1_ at 0,3,12 hours after switch to non-fermentable carbon source; Proteomics: Wt vs mct1_ at 12 hours after switch to non-fermentable carbon source; Metabolomics: Wt vs mct1_ at 0,15,30,60,180 minutes after switch to non-fermentable carbon source"	"Values were obtained by comparing mct1_ to WT values for each time-point. P-values were calculated using a 2-tailed T-test assuming heteroscedasticity, then corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure."	/data/sce_mct1_omics/sce_mct1_12hr_counts_diffx.txt; /data/sce_mct1_omics/proteomics_mct1_12hr.txt; /data/sce_mct1_omics/metabolomics_timecourse_mct1.txt	/data/databases/mct1_timecourse.json
